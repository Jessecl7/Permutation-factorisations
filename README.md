# Permutation-factorisations
Various programs that calculate the numbers of different types of permutation factorisation.  Some of these use recursive programming, and some make more use of Sage's in-built functions.

Monotone single and double hurwitz factorisations are counted, as well as factorisations that use specific sets of transpositions as factors.  These are sometimes counted up to various different notions of equivalency.  Some of this code was used to test results from a paper written with my supervisor, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08354.
